# odin-recipes
# this is an example project for THE ODIN PROJECT that sets up a basic HTML website to help peole find recipes.
# to get to this point, I had to create a repository in GIT, clone into my GIT from the terminal, and open and edit this read me file!
# going forward, i think this assignment will help me create a basically functional website.
